- Additional GCP project was created for Docker related tasks.

- Docker engine was deployed remotely in GCE instance by 'docker-machine' utility.

- Dockerfile was created to compose Reddit-app image.

- Reddit-app container was fired up from Reddit-app image on a remote docker engine via 'docker-machine'.

- Reddit-app image was pushed to the Docker Hub.

- Various test were performed with containers to understand how containers can be used/controlled/configured from CLI.

- * Terraform configuration with multiple instance support was added. Number of running instances can be controlled by -var 'instance_count = #' switch.

- * Ansible configuration with roles and plays that may be used to deploy Docker Engine and to run Reddit-app container were added.

- * Packer template with ready to go Docker Engine was prepared. Ansible provisioner was used to prepare it.

- Reddit App was segregated into microservices

- Each microservice was placed into different container

- Microservices communicate with their counterparts by means of network aliases (much like ad-hoc DNS records)

- To get smaller containers we should rewrite Dockerfiles. We have to use alpine linux, install only necessary packages and delete caches after all.

- Docker volume was created to add statefulness to MongoDB microservice.

- Different network types for Docker were tested.

- Docker-Compose utility was installed and used in conjunction with an yml configuration file to perform a complex deployment of microservices of Reddit App.

- Docker-Compose declarative yml file was parametirezed to use environment variables.

- "Each configuration has a project name. If you supply a -p flag, you can specify a project name. If you donâ€™t specify the flag, Compose uses the current directory name."

- docker-dompose.yml file was modified to use bind volumes (to change application code on fly) and "command" parameter to override Dockerfiles CMD arguments on build.

- GitlabCI CE was installed (Docker+Omnibus) and configured.

- Example project was created to test CI/CD pipelines and runners.

- Reddit app source code was added to repository to perform some basic tests over it.

- Simple test was defined to demonstrate how CI/CD pipeline works.

- Example project notifications were intergrated with Slack chat via webhooks (https://devops-team-otus.slack.com/messages/CDABTQYMR/).

- Basic infrastructure (terraform + ansible) was defined and test to provide a scalable number of Gitlab CI runners in Google cloud.

- GitlabCI configuration was tuned up to accept connections over SSL. GitlabCI local Registry support was also enabled.

- GitlabCI pipelines were extended by means of variuis selectors like a "only/except/when".

- A couple of dynamic environments was defined in pipelines.

- "build_server" step was added into "build" stage in order to create 'sandbox' server with the Docker running inside (via gcloud utility).

- "deploy_application" step was added into "build" stage in order to build and push Docker container with Reddit application into GitlabCi Registry from where it rolls out onto 'sandbox' server. ( via ansible + gce.py )

- "delete_server" step was added into "build" stage to delete 'sandbox' server after all (manually).

- Dockerized Prometheus was configured to monitor microservices health status.

- Node exporter container was used to monitor the status of the docker-machine.

- Percona mongodb exporter container was used to monitor various mongodb metrics of the post_db microservice.

- Blackbox exporter container was configured and used to perform basic external checks (like http response codes, icmp probes, a tcp port open/closed status) of the microservices.

- The makefile was added to build and push microservices images. It uses Dockerfiles located in src/* directories.
