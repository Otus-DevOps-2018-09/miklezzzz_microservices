Based on an output of <docker inspect image_id> vs <docker inspect contrainter_id> i suppose that the main difference between Docker image and Docker container is the fact that a container is a running(or stopped) instance of an image with additional features like top writeable layer to hold any changes while operating and network interfaces for communications.

"Parent" attribute of a container is equal to "Image" attribite of an image and it means that a container's file system is build on top of an image while an image itself is a set of read-only layers (each layer consists of changes from previous layer).
